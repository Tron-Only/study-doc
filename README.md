## Repository Setup Guide

To use DocuRepo effectively, your GitHub repository should follow these conventions:

### Repository Structure

```
your-notes-repo/
├── README.md
├── Subject Folder 1/
│   ├── Assets/              # Images for this subject
│   │   ├── diagram.png
│   │   └── screenshot.jpg
│   ├── Notes/
│   │   ├── 1. Introduction.md
│   │   └── 2. Chapter Two.md
│   ├── Flashcards/          # Optional flashcard decks
│   │   ├── Chapter1.yaml
│   │   └── Chapter2.yaml
│   └── Summary.md
├── Subject Folder 2/
│   ├── Assets/
│   │   └── image.png
│   ├── Notes/
│   │   └── topic.md
│   └── Flashcards/
│       └── deck.yaml
└── ...
```

### Important Requirements

1. **Branch**: Use `main` as your default branch (not `master`)
2. **Assets Folder**: Store images in an `Assets` folder at the appropriate level
3. **Public Repository**: Repository must be public (private repos not yet supported)
4. **File Extensions**: Use `.md` for Markdown files, `.yaml` for flashcard decks
5. **Filename Characters**: Avoid these characters in filenames: `[ ] # ^ | %`
   - These characters may cause parsing issues or URL encoding problems
   - Use hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`) instead of spaces
   - Example: `my-notes.md` instead of `my notes.md` or `my%20notes.md`

### Image Conventions

DocuRepo automatically transforms relative image paths to GitHub raw URLs. Here's how to reference images:

#### Supported Path Formats

```markdown
<!-- Go up one directory from Notes/ to Subject Folder/, then into Assets/ -->
![My Diagram](../Assets/diagram.png)

<!-- Relative to current directory -->
![Screenshot](./Assets/screenshot.png)

<!-- Just the filename (assumes Assets is in current directory) -->
![Image](Assets/image.png)

<!-- Absolute URLs work as-is -->
![External Image](https://example.com/image.png)
```

#### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Image in parent folder's Assets**
```
File: STU 1204/Notes/1. Introduction.md
Image: STU 1204/Assets/Pasted image.png
Reference: ![Diagram](../Assets/Pasted image.png)
Result: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/REPO/main/STU%201204/Assets/Pasted%20image.png
```

**Scenario 2: Image in same folder's Assets**
```
File: README.md (in root)
Image: Assets/logo.png
Reference: ![Logo](Assets/logo.png)
Result: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/REPO/main/Assets/logo.png
```

**Scenario 3: Image in subfolder's Assets**
```
File: Physics/Notes/lecture1.md
Image: Physics/Notes/Assets/formula.png
Reference: ![Formula](./Assets/formula.png)
Result: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/REPO/main/Physics/Notes/Assets/formula.png
```

### Flashcard Deck Format

Create flashcard decks using YAML syntax in a `Flashcards` folder:

```yaml
# Chapter1.yaml
title: Introduction to Computer Science
cards:
  - id: cs-101
    front: What is an algorithm?
    back: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
  
  - id: cs-102
    front: Define Big O notation
    back: A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
  
  - id: cs-103
    front: What are the three basic control structures?
    back: |
      1. Sequence - executing statements in order
      2. Selection - choosing between alternatives (if/else)
      3. Iteration - repeating statements (loops)
```

**Note**: Use YAML's multiline syntax (`|`) to preserve newlines in flashcard content. The app properly renders multiline text with preserved formatting.

**Flashcard Deck Requirements:**
- Must be in a folder named `Flashcards` (case-insensitive)
- Use `.yaml` or `.yml` file extension
- Include `title` and `cards` fields
- Each card must have `id`, `front`, and `back` fields
- Use YAML's multiline syntax (`|`) for longer content

### Tips for Organizing Content

1. **Keep Assets Close**: Place the `Assets` folder at the same level as your notes for that subject
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name images descriptively (e.g., `database-erd-diagram.png` instead of `image1.png`)
3. **No Spaces in Filenames**: While supported, it's better to use hyphens or underscores
4. **Optimize Images**: Compress images before committing to keep your repo size manageable
5. **Use Relative Paths**: Always use relative paths (`../Assets/...`) instead of absolute GitHub URLs
6. **Group Flashcards**: Organize flashcard decks by topic or chapter for easier navigation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm (or npm/yarn)
- A public GitHub repository with your notes

### Adding Custom Features

To add a new Markdown feature:

1. Edit `components/markdown-viewer.tsx`
2. Add your custom component to the `components` prop of `ReactMarkdown`
3. Follow the existing patterns for callouts and Mermaid diagrams

Example:
```typescript
components={{
  // ... existing components
  img: (props) => {
    // Your custom image handling
  },
}}
```

To add a new theme:

1. Edit `components/theme/theme-provider.tsx`
2. Add a new theme object to the `THEMES` array
3. Define all required color tokens using OKLCH values

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import your repository
3. No additional configuration needed
4. Your app will be live at `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Deploy to Netlify

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Build command: `pnpm build`
4. Publish directory: `.next`

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Update `next.config.ts`:
```typescript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  basePath: '/your-repo-name',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
}
```

2. Build and deploy:
```bash
pnpm build
# Push the `out` folder to gh-pages branch
```

### Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic functionality. However, you can optionally set:

- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: For higher API rate limits (optional)
- Currently supports public repositories only

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading

1. Check that your repository uses the `main` branch (not `master`)
2. Verify the image path is correct relative to the Markdown file
3. Ensure the image is committed and pushed to GitHub
4. Check browser console for 404 errors
5. Verify the image file exists in the `Assets` folder

### Sidebar Not Loading

1. Verify the repository is public
2. Check that you entered the correct GitHub URL
3. Look for rate limiting errors in the console (GitHub API has limits for unauthenticated requests)
4. Try refreshing the repository from the repository dropdown

### Markdown Not Rendering

1. Ensure files have `.md` extension
2. Check for syntax errors in your Markdown
3. Verify the file exists in the repository
4. Clear browser cache and localStorage if needed

### Flashcards Not Appearing

1. Ensure the folder is named `Flashcards` (case-insensitive)
2. Verify deck files use `.yaml` or `.yml` extension
3. Check YAML syntax is valid (use a YAML validator)
4. Ensure each card has `id`, `front`, and `back` fields
5. Check browser console for parsing errors

### Theme Not Saving

1. Check that localStorage is enabled in your browser
2. Ensure you're not in private/incognito mode
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check browser console for storage quota errors

### Mobile Display Issues

1. **Horizontal scrolling**: All layouts are now responsive and prevent horizontal overflow
2. **Buttons too small**: All touch targets meet 44x44px minimum for accessibility
3. **Sidebar stays open**: Sidebar now auto-closes on mobile after clicking any link
4. **Can't find menu**: Look for the floating trigger button (panel icon) in the top-left when sidebar is closed
5. **Text overflow**: Theme selector and buttons adapt to screen size; separate mobile layouts prevent overflow
